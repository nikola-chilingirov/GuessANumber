# The "Guess A Number" Game
This is a simple console game in which your opponent, **"the computer"**, chooses random number between certain boundary and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number.
The programe use "while loop" to iterate your guesses until input the right number. With If-else statement the program give you hints.
