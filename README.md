# The "Guess A Number" Game
- **Project goals**
  
This is a simple console game in which your opponent, **"the computer"**, chooses random number between certain boundary and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number.
- **Solution**

The programe use "while loop" to iterate your guesses until input the right number. With If-else statement the program give you hints.
